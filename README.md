# odin-rockpaperscissors
This is the rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project. 

Eventually I will add a UI to this project, for now the results appear in the console of the browser.

This project solidified what I've learned about functions, mostly syntax and how to actually implement them.

This was also my first interactive project! It was a fun milestone on my learning journey.
